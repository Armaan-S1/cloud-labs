# Lab 05 – Azure Cost Management and SLAs

## 🎯 Objective
Understand how Azure pricing, cost management, and service-level agreements (SLAs) work.  
Use the Azure Pricing Calculator to estimate costs and explore SLA guarantees.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed

### 1. Azure Pricing Calculator
- Navigated to [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).
- Configured an estimate for a *Virtual Machine* and *Storage Account*.
- Selected region, size, and redundancy options.
- Reviewed estimated monthly costs.

### 2. Cost Management + Billing
- Explored *Cost Management + Billing* in the Azure Portal.
- Reviewed billing scopes and available reports.

### 3. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
- Researched SLA guarantees for Azure services.  
  Example:  
  - *Virtual Machines*: 99.9% uptime for single-instance VMs.  
  - *Storage Accounts*: 99.99% uptime for read/write availability.  
- Understood how SLAs combine when multiple services are used.

## ✅ Key Takeaways
- Azure costs depend on resource type, size, location, and redundancy.  
- The *Pricing Calculator* helps estimate spend before deployment.  
- *Cost Management + Billing* provides monitoring and optimization.  
- SLAs define the uptime and reliability you can expect from Azure services.
