# Lab 10 ‚Äì Describe Azure Identity, Access, and Security

## üéØ Objective
In this lab, I explored how Azure manages identity, access, and security using:
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Security features like MFA and Conditional Access

## ‚úÖ Lab Summary
- *Microsoft Entra ID* provides cloud identity management for apps, devices, and users.  
- *RBAC* ensures least-privilege access to Azure resources.  
- *MFA* and *Conditional Access* strengthen security against unauthorized access.
