# AZ-900 – Module 2: Core Architectural Components of Azure

## 📝 Key Learnings
- *Azure Regions & Availability Zones* – provide resilience and redundancy.  
- *Resource Groups* – logical containers for Azure resources.  
- *Azure Resource Manager (ARM)* – the deployment and management layer for all resources.  
- *Azure Subscriptions* – boundaries for billing, access, and governance.  
- *Management Groups* – organize multiple subscriptions.  

## ✅ Outcome
I learned how Azure is structured (regions, RGs, subscriptions) and how these components work together to deliver cloud services.
