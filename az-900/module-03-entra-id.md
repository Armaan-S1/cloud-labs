## üîë Key Concepts

### What is Microsoft Entra ID?
- Cloud-based identity and access management service.  
- Provides *single sign-on (SSO), **multi-factor authentication (MFA), and **conditional access*.  
- Manages access to Microsoft 365, Azure resources, SaaS apps, and custom apps.  

---

### Identity vs. Access
- *Authentication* ‚Üí Verifies who you are (password, MFA, biometric).  
- *Authorization* ‚Üí Decides what you can do (roles, RBAC).  

---

### Users
- Individual identities stored in Entra ID.  
- Can be created manually, synced from on-prem AD, or invited as guests.  

---

### Groups
- Collections of users for easier management.  
- Types:  
  - *Security groups* ‚Üí Control access to resources.  
  - *Microsoft 365 groups* ‚Üí Collaboration in Teams, Outlook, SharePoint.  

---

### Roles
- Entra ID uses *role-based access control (RBAC)*.  
- Examples:  
  - *Global Administrator* ‚Üí Full access to tenant.  
  - *User Administrator* ‚Üí Can manage users.  
  - *Reader* ‚Üí View-only permissions.  

---

### Authentication Methods
- *Password* (basic).  
- *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)* ‚Üí adds a second layer of security.  
- *Self-Service Password Reset (SSPR)* ‚Üí users reset their own passwords.  

---

### Conditional Access
- Allows administrators to enforce policies.  
- Example: Require MFA only when signing in from outside the corporate network.  

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Lab 03 (Practical)
- View Entra ID tenant.  
- Create a new user.  
- Create a security group.  
- Add user to group.  
- Assign a role (e.g., Reader).  

---

## ‚úÖ Summary
- Microsoft Entra ID is Azure‚Äôs identity and access management service.  
- Provides authentication (login) and authorization (permissions).  
- Users, groups, and roles simplify identity management.  
- MFA and Conditional Access add extra security.
