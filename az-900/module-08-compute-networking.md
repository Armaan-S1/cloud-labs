# Module 08 ‚Äì Describe Azure Compute and Networking Services

## üåê Overview
This module covers the fundamental compute and networking services in Azure that allow you to host applications and connect resources securely.

---

## ‚ö° Compute Services

### 1. Virtual Machines (VMs)
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service).
- Full control over OS and applications.
- Can scale up or out.

### 2. App Services
- PaaS (Platform as a Service).
- Host web apps, APIs, and mobile backends.
- Auto-scaling and built-in CI/CD integration.

### 3. Azure Functions
- Serverless compute (event-driven).
- Runs small pieces of code without managing servers.
- Pay-per-execution model.

### 4. Azure Container Instances & AKS
- Run Docker containers easily.
- AKS (Kubernetes Service) manages containerized workloads.

## üåê Networking Services

### 1. Virtual Networks (VNet)
- Logical isolation of resources.
- Support for subnets, firewalls, and peering.

### 2. Load Balancer
- Distributes traffic across multiple resources.
- Ensures high availability.

### 3. Application Gateway
- Layer 7 load balancer.
- Supports SSL termination, URL routing, and WAF (Web Application Firewall).

### 4. VPN Gateway
- Secure connection between on-premises and Azure resources.

### 5. ExpressRoute
- Private, dedicated high-speed connection to Azure (bypasses the public internet).

## üìå Summary
- *Compute*: VMs (IaaS), App Services (PaaS), Functions (Serverless), Containers (AKS/ACI).  
- *Networking*: VNets, Load Balancer, App Gateway, VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute.  
- Together, these services power scalable, secure, and reliable applications in Azure.
