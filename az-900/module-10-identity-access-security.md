# Module 10 – Describe Azure Identity, Access, and Security

## 🌐 Overview
Identity and security are core to Azure. This module covers authentication, authorization, and security controls.

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Microsoft Entra ID (Azure Active Directory)
- Cloud-based identity and access management (IAM).
- Provides single sign-on (SSO) and integration with Microsoft 365, SaaS apps, and custom apps.
- Features:
  - Authentication (user sign-in)
  - Federation (hybrid AD sync)
  - Identity Protection

### 2. Authentication vs Authorization
- *Authentication* → Proves identity (who you are).  
- *Authorization* → Defines permissions (what you can do).  

### 3. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained access management for Azure resources.
- Roles include:
  - *Owner* → Full access including delegation.
  - *Contributor* → Create and manage resources but not grant access.
  - *Reader* → View resources only.

### 4. Security Tools
- *Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)* → Extra layer of protection beyond passwords.  
- *Conditional Access* → Policies that enforce security based on device, location, or risk.  
- *Microsoft Defender for Cloud* → Provides security posture management and threat protection.

## 📌 Summary
- *Entra ID* → Azure’s cloud-based IAM solution.  
- *RBAC* → Controls who can do what.  
- *MFA & Conditional Access* → Strengthen access security.  
- *Defender for Cloud* → Monitors and protects workloads.
