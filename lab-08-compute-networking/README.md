# Lab 08 – Describe Azure Compute and Networking Services

## 🎯 Objective
In this lab, I explored common *compute* and *networking* services available in Azure.

---

## 📝 Steps Performed

### 1. Compute Services
- Reviewed *Virtual Machines (VMs)* in the Azure Portal.
- Checked available VM sizes and configurations.
- Opened *Azure App Services* to see how web apps are deployed.
- Viewed *Azure Functions* (serverless compute).

### 2. Networking Services
- Navigated to *Virtual Networks (VNets)* in the Portal.
- Observed how subnets are structured.
- Opened *Azure Load Balancer* and *Application Gateway* service pages.
- Checked *VPN Gateway* and *ExpressRoute* options.

### 3. Key Observations
- Compute is about *running applications* (VMs, containers, functions).
- Networking is about *connecting services* securely and efficiently.

## ✅ Lab Summary
- *Virtual Machines* → Provide scalable compute.  
- *App Services* → PaaS for web and API apps.  
- *Azure Functions* → Serverless compute model.  
- *Virtual Network* → Foundation for secure resource communication.  
- *Load Balancer & App Gateway* → Distribute traffic efficiently.  
- *VPN Gateway & ExpressRoute* → Secure hybrid connectivity.
